* Design of MFD pages is a bit unfortunate. Refactor with inheritance instead of ugly switch/case constructs.
* Refactor various interfaces to be consistent. ATM there is a index-driven, class-based and struct-based approach.
* Think about making sub-objects sub-vessels
* Make coordinate system more generic. I.e. use files with ini-like structure to define e.g. beacon-arrays and hangar positions.
